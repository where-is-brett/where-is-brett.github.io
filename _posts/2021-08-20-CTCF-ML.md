This app is an extension to the existing MATLAB tool <a href="https://au.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/97377-corrected-total-cell-fluorescence">Measure Cell Fluorescence</a>, an attempt to improve measurement efficiency by reducing manual labour wherever possible. However, cell fluorescence measurements rely on the accurate delineation of cellular objects, which is itself a time-consuming process irreplaceable by computer algorithms. This significantly limited the optimisable components in the <a href="https://theolb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/imaging/measuring-cell-fluorescence-using-imagej.html">procedure</a>.


This work is an attempt to speed up the ROI delineation by deploying a pre-trained deep learning model. Currently, the model is being tested and fine-tuned. The pre-release versions will be posted here in upcoming weeks.
