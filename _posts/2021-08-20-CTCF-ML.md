## Introduction
This app is an extension to the existing MATLAB tool <a href="https://au.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/97377-corrected-total-cell-fluorescence">Measure Cell Fluorescence</a>, an attempt to improve measurement efficiency by reducing manual labour wherever possible. However, cell fluorescence measurements rely on the accurate delineation of cellular objects, which is itself a time-consuming process, irreplaceable by a simple computer algorithm. This significantly limited the optimisable components in the <a href="https://theolb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/imaging/measuring-cell-fluorescence-using-imagej.html">procedure</a>.

This work is an open source project in attempt to speed up the ROI delineation by implementing a deep learning model. The model assists the labelling process while the user has the option to manually adjust the predicted ROIs. This tool can also be used to generate annotation images in the form of binary masks and instance masks.

Currently, I am working to deliver the most suitable DCNN model for immunofluorescent-labelled images in the mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. The pre-release version implements a [U-Net](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597) + [ResNet-34](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) model architecture. The model was built and trained on Colaboratory with open-source datasets. If you fancy a go at it with your own dataset, you can download the Jupyter notebook [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uotbBefDHes1gt3Eu_YwxBAK9ELeWUiw?usp=sharing).


## Pre-requisites
* A valid MATLAB license
* Deep Learning Toolbox (install from MATLAB Add-ons)

## Measure Corrected Total Cell Fluorescence (CTCF)
1. Load an image from menu: File > Open... > Image.
2. Load model, allow up to 20 seconds.
3. Draw bounding boxes on the image axes to predict cellular ROIs. Note: any feature that touches the borders is ignored.
4. (Optional) Manually draw additional cellular ROIs, or adjust existing ROIs.
5. Click the 'Label' toggle to switch to begin selecting background regions.
6. To calculate CTCF, navigate to menu bar: Measure > CTCF
7. Results are displayed in a table.

**Tips:**
Right click on an ROI object to delete it.
Use the label visibility toggle to view the order of ROI objects.
If you are not familiar with deep learning, read [this](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/thresholding) before adjusting the threshold knob.
