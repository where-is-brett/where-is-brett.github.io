title: "A Deep Learning-Based Software for Neural Cell Segmentation and Quantification"
excerpt: "Segmentation of cellular structures is at the heart of biomedical image analysis. Manually performing segmentation is time-consuming and prone to inter-observer and intra-observer bias. Deep learning has proven effective in object detection and segmentation tasks. We present a deep learning-based algorithm for cell segmentation of immunofluorescent-labelled images. Our model was trained on a dataset containing a variety of cells and a total of 57,045 segmented objects. We implemented contrast normalisation and image augmentation to achieve a robust model. A program was created to calculate the total corrected cell fluorescence of neurons in the mouse model of Alzheimerâ€™s disease."
