You probably know me as a physicist if you have worked alongside me or read my CV. Or you may know me as that minimal house DJ from a memorable party. You might even know me as a drummer from a live gig before lockdown. No matter what brought you here, you will likely find out about a side of my life that was unknown to you. Enjoy!
