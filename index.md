You probably know me as a physicist if you have worked alongside me or read my CV. Or you may know me as that minimal house DJ from a memorable party. You might even know me as a drummer from a live gig before lockdown. No matter what brought you here, you will likely find out about a side of my life that was unknown to you. Enjoy!

## what's new?
Music theory is not easy to grasp. Many of us struggle to even remember how to derive a scale or a chord given a key signature. As a producer, I often need to look up chords and scales all over the internet and end up with a dozen tabs open. So I created an [app]({{site.url}}/app/find-scale) to display chords and scales all in one place. Desktop viewers may benefit from the playback function.
